> A node CLI client for working with Squarespace



## Project Overview
This project aims to provide some awesome Squarespace functionality from the command line.



## Features

### Export Content
* `sqs export` - Export a Squarespace page in JSON or HTML.


## Roadmap
* Bulk export.
* Parse sitemap. Chain to export.
* Get site info.
* Improved logger.
* Lots of other cool stuff :)

### Support
I'm largely using ES6/ES7, so this project may not work on older versions of Node.js. 6.0+ ftw :-D.
